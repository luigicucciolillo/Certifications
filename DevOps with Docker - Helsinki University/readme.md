1- DevOps with Docker: Learn Docker fundamentals, including images and containers, and how to build Docker images for existing projects.
2- DevOps with Docker: docker-compose: Master managing multi-container applications using Docker Compose and understand its role in orchestration.
3- DevOps with Docker: security and optimization: Learn to optimize Docker images for production, improve security, and explore advanced orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
