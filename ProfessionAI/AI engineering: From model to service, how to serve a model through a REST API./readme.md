# From Model to Service: Deploying ML Models as REST APIs - AI Engineering Workshop

duration: 3 hours

[ProfessionAI link](https://www.profession.ai/)

In this three-hour workshop, we explored how to transform a trained machine learning **model** into a functioning **service** accessible through a **REST API**. Using **Flask** as the lightweight web framework and **Uvicorn** as the ASGI server, we learned how to expose the model so that clients can send **validated inputs** and receive **predicted outputs** in real time.

The session emphasized understanding the complete data flow: from **input validation**, through the model’s **learned patterns**, to the **generation of outputs**. Special attention was given to **data control and consistency**, ensuring that every request handled by the API maintains accuracy, transparency, and security.
