**Python Programming (Winter Camp 2025)** is an introductory, hands-on training program designed to build solid foundations in Python software development through a structured combination of **theory**, **guided practice**, and **practical exercises**.
The objective is to enable learners to master Python syntax and core programming constructs, applying them immediately to concrete problems, while progressively introducing modern **AI-assisted coding tools**.

The course starts with the **fundamentals of the language**, focusing on *variables and data types*. Topics include arithmetic operations, correct handling of divisions, powers and modulo operations, variable swapping techniques, as well as *type casting* and string formatting. These concepts are reinforced through a set of targeted exercises.

The program then introduces **data collections**, covering structures used to organize and manipulate data. Practical activities are applied to realistic scenarios, such as managing *school report data*, to demonstrate how data structures are used in real-world contexts.

The module on **conditional statements** addresses control-flow logic using if/else constructs and proper decision branching. This is followed by a dedicated section on **loops**, aimed at developing the ability to automate repetitive tasks and iterative logic through exercises involving powers, ranking logic (“second place”), register management, and palindrome detection.

The course subsequently covers **procedural programming**, with a focus on problem decomposition into functions, code reuse, and logical organization of programs. Exercises include geometric calculations (circle area) and rule-based logic (leap year detection), reinforcing functional structuring and program clarity.

To complete the curriculum, a dedicated module explores **key AI tools supporting software development**. This section covers AI-assisted code generation and development workflows using widely adopted platforms and tools such as **Google Colab**, **ChatGPT**, **Cursor**, and **GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code**. It also introduces **AI programming techniques**, including *vibe coding* and *engineered approaches*, aimed at improving productivity, prototyping speed, and code quality through controlled prompting and iterative refinement.
