# Description

- 7 hours of study material

This course provides a theoretical and applied overview of modern Artificial Intelligence systems, with a primary focus on Large Language Models (LLMs), Agentic AI, and Transformer-based architectures. It is structured to integrate foundational theory with guided laboratory activities, ensuring a clear connection between underlying concepts and their practical implementation.

The program examines the training and operational principles of LLMs, including prompt engineering methodologies and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Practical sessions address the design and implementation of RAG pipelines using established frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex. The course further introduces Agentic AI, covering the architectural components and development patterns of autonomous AI agents, supported by hands-on laboratories in Python and the use of modern agent frameworks including LangGraph, CrewAI, and AutoGen, applied to representative real-world scenarios.

The final modules are dedicated to Transformer architectures and the Hugging Face ecosystem, providing theoretical insight into self-attention mechanisms, encoder–decoder models, and sequence-to-sequence paradigms. These concepts are reinforced through applied laboratories focused on fine-tuning transformer models for Natural Language Processing tasks, including text classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), translation, and summarization.
