## Clean Tech Academy

The owner of this badge has completed the Clean Tech Academy programme, realised by the Politecnico di Torino and Miticoro Foundation with the support of EIT, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.

Clean Tech Academy is the gateway to mastering advanced clean technologies and shaping a sustainable future. In today’s rapidly changing technology landscape, staying ahead not only means innovating, but also acquiring the right skills to drive change. Clean Tech Academy was created to support a new generation of European innovators – from students and young professionals to employees of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – in harnessing the transformative power of advanced technologies, with a particular focus on clean technologies.


The programme aims to provide the necessary skills to respond to the pressing needs of industry and society in terms of decarbonisation through different modalities:


- Dynamic learning modules: an online platform with challenge-based learning modules, developed and led by industry experts. These modules provide practical, hands-on experience to explore the Clean Tech landscape, linking emerging trends to real market needs.
- Collaboration and crowdsourcing: a dynamic ecosystem where users must collaborate, share ideas and co-create innovative solutions. This approach not only improves learning but stimulates innovation through collective intelligence.
- Digital Project Showcases: participants will have the opportunity to present their projects, gaining visibility and feedback from colleagues and potential investors. This functionality encourages the practical application of acquired skills and prepares participants for success in the market.

## Issued by Politecnico di Torino

Politecnico di Torino (www.polito.it) was founded in 1906 and has its roots in the Technical School for Engineers created in 1859. 

It is internationally ranked among the most important universities in Europe for engineering and architecture studies.

Politecnico is a center of excellence for education and research in engineering, architecture, design and planning and it works in close cooperation with the socio-economic system. It is a comprehensive Research University where education and research complement each other and create synergies  in order to address the needs of the economic system, of the local community and, above all, of its students. 

Politecnico is committed to a strong internationalization process of its teaching, research and technology transfer activities:  not only does it work in cooperation with the best universities and research centers in world, but  it has also been signing agreements and contracts with important international corporations,  as well as local businesses, meaning to be for  the latter a focal point for innovation.
